# Advent of Code 2022 Java Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing some solutions for the puzzles of the
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) event, implemented in
Java.

My approach to the event is not intended to compete in the leaderboards, but to
be used as an opportunity to learn and improve my skills in the Java
programming language and in algorithms. I have been primarily using JavaScript
and Python in the past and I want to try similar languages.

Please note that the solutions might look very ugly since this is a spare time
project. Other than that, feel free to use them as a starting point for your
own solutions, or to compare them to your own implementations for educational
purposes.

Each puzzle has its own file, named accordingly, such as "d01p1.java" means the
day 1 part 1 puzzle. To run the program, use the command `java <filename>.java`
from the base directory.

The input files are in the `input` directory. You can replace them with your
own input data.

Happy coding!
