# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the puzzles of the [Advent of Code
2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) event, implemented in Java. The goal is to
learn the Java programming language and to practice algorithms.

Please note that the solutions may not be the most elegant, as this is a
spare-time project. Each puzzle has its own file, named accordingly. For
example, "d01p1.java" is the solution for the day 1, part 1 puzzle. To run the
program, use the command `java <filename>.java` from the base directory.
